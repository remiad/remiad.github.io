<p>Hi! My name is Rémi Durocher and a Mechanical Engineer with a passion for sustainability.</p>
<p>During my time in school, have had the chance to participate in a number of opportunities including competing on my schools FSAE team, help plan and host a national engineering competition, and intern at a Fortune 500 company (twice!). </p>
<p>Beyond school, I've always been a tinkerer at heart (this is what led me to do engineering.) I've used what I have learned in my classes to work on some projects tied to hobbies I'm interested in. These projects have both helped develop my engineering skills and have be great fun tinker with. (See Projects tab for more.)</p>
<p>In my spare time when I'm not tinkering or working on a project, I love to be active and try new sports. (My two most recent sports that I've tried have been Mauy Thai and Powerlifting.) Along with being active, I'm a sucker for travel and exploring new cultures (especially food).</p>

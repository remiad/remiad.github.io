Personal Website 


This is my personal website that I am currently working on. I'm migrating my website from Wix over to github to give me more control how my projects are displayed (rather than just Wix Templates)
but also give me an opportunity to learn HTML, CSS and JS.

Migration is going to take some time as I'm learning, but it will be done! (eventually...)
